# client-boilerplate

This is meant to be a personal boilerplate for client side apps. It's built off
of react-redux. This boilerplate is a personal reflection of my favorite
front-end dev stack, which right now is based on react and redux.

## Scripts

- `npm test` Runs the tests
- `npm start` Starts up watcher and livereload on port:8080
- `npm run build` Does a production build of the assets
- `npm run clean` Cleans out all of the assets from the dist folder
- `npm run gh-pages` Pushes up the dist folder to github pages
- `npm run deploy` Does a build, commit, push, and deploy to gh-pages
